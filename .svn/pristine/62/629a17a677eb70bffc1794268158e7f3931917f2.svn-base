                   LORIS Installation Script
---------------------------------------------------------------------


PHP appears to be installed.

PEAR appears to be installed.

Please answer the following questions. You'll be asked:

  1) Your project directory name from section A) of the Installation Guide.
     (Will be used to modify the paths for Imaging data in the generated
     config.xml file for LORIS, and may also be used to automatically
     create/install apache config files.)

  2) A name for the MySQL Database. This should be
     a simple identifier such as "Loris" or "Abc_Def".
     This database will be created later on so please make sure
     a database with the same name does not already exist.

  3) The hostname for the machine where the MySQL server will run on
     (this is where we'll create the database).

  4) The MySQL username that the Loris system will use to connect
     to this server and database; this MySQL account will be
     created later on so please make sure a user with the same name
     does not already exist.

  5) The password for this username (it will be set later on).

  6) Another password for the 'admin' account of the Loris DB
     (it will also be set later on).

  7) Credentials of an existing root MySQL account to install the
     default schema. This will only be used once, to create and
     populate the default tables, and to grant privileges to the
     newly created MySQL user in part 3).
